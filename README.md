# Customer Relationship Management Tool for a financial services firm

### Description:
This mini-project was completed as a part of my academic curriculum in my second year (sophomore year) first semester of Engineering. This CRM application is just an extensively demonstrative application,coded for the purpose of showcasing the advantages and use cases of a CRM in various business sectors. The application is customized for a Financial services firm like BajajFinServ or any lending & asset management firm. Tech stack includes Java, JSPs, Servlets & MySQL.

### Functionalities:
The application takes into account the following entities : Employees, Admin, Customers
1) Maintaining an up to date database of customers, probable leads, available products is maintained.
2) Employees can add new leads, edit as well as delete the existing leads. An employee can however perform these operations on just his own leads database.
3) Leads can be directly converted to customers, without having to re-enter his data, which when done manually is prone to data inconsistency. Depending on the product bought, the system calculates the monthly installments as well as sets deadlines for receiving payments from the customer.
4) Since this CRM is designed for a loan-lending company, all the customers are categorized as per their repayment capacity. Thus loan amount can be granted to them only within a fixed range.
The employee can track payment details of every customer, that is payment for which months is pending, etc. He can thus contact the customers accordingly.
5) Employees can create a to-do list for themselves, as well as set a deadline for the same. If the task isn’t completed by the deadline, he would be notified about it.
6) Various analyses are provided such as which is the most sold product of the company, sales analysis of the past 5 months. Easy to understand graphics such as pie-charts showing number of sales of each product, status of leads in the database, have been projected. This will help the manager know where they’re falling short and hence take action on the same.
7) For an employee to analyse his own performance, dashboard will show his most sold product as well as his total number sales.
8) The dashboard will project analyses of data for the whole company, as well as performance of the logged in employee.
9) Top salesman and Leader Board is displayed, which will help the company reward its deserving employees.
10) Along with the employee login, customer login is provided. Customers can check their pending payments and make payments through this portal. The employee attending that customer would then see its updated status.
